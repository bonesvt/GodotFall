# Titanfall Roguelike: Movement Prototype (Godot 4)

First playable build: a pilot movement controller and a test level.

## Run it
1. Install Godot 4.3 or newer (standard build, not .NET): https://godotengine.org/download
2. Open Godot, click **Import**, pick this folder's `project.godot`.
3. Press **F5** (or the Play button). The mouse is captured; Esc frees it, click to recapture.

## Controls
| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| WASD | Move (auto-sprints when moving forward) |
| Space | Jump, double jump, wall jump |
| C / Ctrl | Crouch; slide when running |
| Q / E / Right mouse | Grapple (hold to reel in, release or jump to let go) |
| R | Respawn |
| H | Toggle help |

## Abilities
- **Sprint** with fast acceleration.
- **Slide**: crouch while running for a speed boost (1.5 s cooldown). Speeds up down slopes. Hold crouch in the air to slide on landing.
- **Slide-hop**: jump out of a slide and keep your speed; landing gives a short window before friction.
- **Double jump**: one air jump that also redirects you toward the keys you hold.
- **Wallrun**: hit a wall at speed while in the air holding W. Lasts up to 1.8 s, slight lift then slow sink, camera tilts. Refreshes the double jump.
- **Wall jump**: Space during (or just after) a wallrun kicks you off the wall.
- **Grapple**: 45 m range, pulls you to the point, 2.5 s cooldown.
- **Air strafing**: you keep momentum in the air but can steer.

## Test level
- Ahead: **wallrun corridor** (two long parallel walls).
- Right: **wall-jump course**, zig-zag panels over red "lava" between two platforms.
- Left: **slide ramp**, walk up, turn around, crouch and slide down.
- Behind: **grapple towers** with floating platforms.

## Tuning
Every number lives in `scripts/player.gd` as an exported variable. Open `scenes/player.tscn`,
select the Player node and tweak values in the Inspector, or change the defaults in the script.
