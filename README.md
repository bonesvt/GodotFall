# Titanfall Roguelike: Combat Prototype (Godot 4)

The movement prototype plus first combat: a weak starter pistol and grunt enemies in an arena.

## Run it
1. Install Godot 4.3 or newer (standard build, not .NET): https://godotengine.org/download
2. Open Godot, click **Import**, pick this folder's `project.godot`.
3. Press **F5** (or the Play button). The mouse is captured; Esc frees it, click to recapture.

## Controls
| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| WASD | Move (auto-sprints when moving forward) |
| Space | Jump, double jump, wall jump |
| C / Ctrl | Crouch; slide when running |
| Q / E / Right mouse | Grapple (hold to reel in, release or jump to let go) |
| Left mouse | Shoot (semi-auto, one click per shot) |
| R | Reload |
| T | Respawn |
| G | Reset the grunt arena |
| H | Toggle help |

## Scrap Titan run loop
Pressing Play starts a run (`scenes/run.tscn`). The movement test level is still at
`scenes/test_level.tscn` (open it and press F6).

1. **Three zones.** Each is a seeded chain of platforms over a void, linked by gaps you
   clear with a sprint jump, a double-jump climb, a wallrun along a blue wall, or the grapple
   on an orange anchor. Grunt squads hold some platforms from behind cover (more of them in
   later zones), and every platform has low walls or blocks you can use as cover too.
   Falling, or getting gunned down, costs 25 pilot integrity and puts you back on the last
   platform you stood on. At 0 the run is over.
2. **Salvage.** Each zone has two caches on side platforms. One is guarded by a grunt squad
   dug in facing you; kill them all to unlock it. Opening a cache
   pauses and offers three titan parts; press 1, 2 or 3 to keep one, or X to leave it.
3. **Your titan is your build.** Four slots: chassis (armor, speed, dashes), weapon (damage),
   core (charged ability: laser burst, shield, overdrive) and kit (extra dash, plating,
   coolant). Empty slots stay scrap. Parts roll Mk I to III, and later zones roll higher.
4. **Titanfall.** Extract from zone 3 into the arena, press V to call your titan in, walk to
   it and press F to embark. Fight the enemy titan (a placeholder): hold left mouse on it to
   fire, Shift to dash out of its red slam circles, V when the core is ready.
5. Kill it and the run is complete. Lose the titan and the run is over. Enter starts a new run.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| F | Open salvage, embark |
| 1 / 2 / 3, X | Pick a part, leave it |
| V | Call in titan, fire core |
| Shift | Titan dash |
| Left mouse | Titan fire |
| Enter | New run (after a run ends) |

Run code lives in `scripts/run/`: `run_manager.gd` (the loop), `run_state.gd` (what a run
carries), `zone_builder.gd` (zone and arena generation), `titan_parts.gd` (part catalog and
stats), `titan.gd`, `boss.gd`, and the cache, guard squad and beacon scripts. The titan is its own
node holding the run's parts, so it can later travel with you as a walking base.

## Abilities
Movement is tuned to feel heavy rather than floaty: gravity is 28 m/s², falling is 35% faster
than rising, and hard landings dip the camera. A jump peaks at about 1.3 m and a double jump
at about 2.5 m.

- **Sprint** with fast acceleration.
- **Slide**: crouch while running for a speed boost (1.5 s cooldown). Speeds up down slopes. Hold crouch in the air to slide on landing.
- **Slide-hop**: jump out of a slide and keep your speed; landing gives a short window before friction.
- **Double jump**: one air jump that also redirects you toward the keys you hold.
- **Wallrun**: hit a wall at speed while in the air holding W. Lasts up to 1.8 s, slight lift then slow sink, camera tilts. Refreshes the double jump.
- **Wall jump**: Space during (or just after) a wallrun kicks you off the wall.
- **Grapple**: 45 m range, pulls you to the point, 2.5 s cooldown.
- **Air strafing**: you keep momentum in the air but can steer.

## Starter pistol (P-08 placeholder)
Weak on purpose, so skill decides fights.
- **Damage**: 20 to the body, 45 to the head. A grunt has 60 HP: three body shots, or a headshot plus a body shot.
- **Falloff**: full damage to 15 m, down to 60% at 35 m.
- **Semi-auto**: 8-round magazine, 1.5 s reload, max ~6 shots/s, but every click is one shot.
- **Bloom**: each shot widens the cone; it only starts recovering 0.25 s after your last shot.
  Paced shots land, spam doesn't. The crosshair gap shows the real cone.
- **Movement**: sprinting and jumping add spread. **Wallrunning and sliding don't**, so shooting off a wall is a pilot skill.
- Recoil kicks the view up and mostly settles back. Hitmarkers: white body, gold head, red kill.

## Grunts
- 60 HP, headshots count above the shoulders. Visor glows red during a 0.4 s wind-up before each shot.
- Spot you by line of sight (40 m), hold around 12 m, strafe, and fire a single 8-damage round every ~1.5 s.
- **Their aim depends on how you move**: about 63% hit chance on a still pilot, ~14% at sprint speed, near zero while wallrunning.
- You have 100 HP that regenerates after 3 s without damage. Dying respawns you and resets the arena.

## Test level
- Ahead: **wallrun corridor** (two long parallel walls).
- Right: **wall-jump course**, zig-zag panels over red "lava" between two platforms.
- Left: **slide ramp**, walk up, turn around, crouch and slide down.
- Behind: **grapple towers** with floating platforms.
- Far right (about 60 m): **grunt arena** with six grunts, cover, and wallrun walls on both sides.

## Tuning
Every number lives in `scripts/player.gd`, `scripts/weapon.gd` and `scripts/grunt.gd` as an exported variable. Open `scenes/player.tscn`,
select the Player node and tweak values in the Inspector, or change the defaults in the script.
